# Frankencode
Good morning all !
Here is the code from the Warboules team for the Frankencode challenge for the night of computing. You will find in the / jeudelavie folder a demonstration page of our code made in JavaScript.

We strongly invite you to go see how we have integrated this game of life into our application. To do this, here is access to our server: http://146.59.202.223/

When you arrive on the first page, you will find an explanation of how the game is integrated into our application.
